# Election Audit Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
This analysis uses Python to perform the task of auditing election results for certain Colorado counties and returns a summarized report. Python opens and reads a .csv file containing data on the ballot id, the county where the vote was cast and the candidate the vote was for and using looping obtains the total amounts of votes by county and for each candidate. Lastly the summarized report is exported to a .txt file for ease of access.
